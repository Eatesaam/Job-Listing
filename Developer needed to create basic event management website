Developer needed to create basic event management website

- Create a system for users to create events/clubs
- The events/clubs are given a dedicated page
- Other users can buy/pay for these events/clubs using our payment gateway account
- The administrators can view and administer the events/clubs created

There will be a limited amount of design work required as well, such as creating a logo and a clean theme.

I would prefer the use of a popular framework (such as Angular). Also would ideally want to make use of AWS.

Project overview available on request.

You will be asked to answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:

Have you previously integrated a payment gateway?
What past project or job have you had that is most like this one and why?
What questions do you have about the project?
Which popular frameworks do you have experience in?
Do you have AWS deploy experience?
